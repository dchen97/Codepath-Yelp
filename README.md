# Project 3 - *Critiq*

**Critiq** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would like to know how to properly set the status bar color.
2. I would also like to know how to implement the filters options like in the example.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I struggled at first with getting the search bar to display correctly as it would tend to disappear when I tried editing the text within the search bar. I also struggled to get it to display the status bar in the Light version like in the example, and eventually I had to give up in order to turn it in.
